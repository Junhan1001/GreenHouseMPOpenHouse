Chiller
[Condenser]Removes heat from the refrigerant which was picked up in the evaporator. 
[Evaporator]Collects the unwanted heat from the AHU (building) and moves this into the refrigerant​
[Expansion Valve]Expand the refrigerant to reduce its pressure and increase its volume allowing it to pick up the unwanted heat in the evaporator
[Compressor]Creates a pressure difference to move the refrigerant around the system
EndChiller

AHU
[Cooling Coil]Cools and dehumidifies the air. Absorbs heat from air and transfers to the chilled-water loop
[Supply Fans]Pulls the air in through the dampers, filters and coils and then pushes it into the ductwork for distribution
EndAHU

CoolingTower
[Fans]To push and force the air into the cooling tower to enhance the evaporation of condenser water from the inlet
[Collection Basin]Located at the bottom of the cooling tower, it collects directs ‘cooler’ water to the chiller
[Motor]Drives the fans of a cooling tower
EndCoolingTower

CwpOpt
[Motor]Transfer power to the pump by converting electrical energy into rotational mechanical energy​
[Discharge]Connection for water discharge
[Suction]Connection for water suction
